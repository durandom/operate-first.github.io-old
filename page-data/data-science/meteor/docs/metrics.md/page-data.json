The <strong><em>high level</em></strong> metrics would be more broadly scoped and concerned on measuring the entire application as a whole, whereas the <strong><em>low level</em></strong> metrics would be more focused on understanding the individual components within the application.</p>\n<h2 id=\"metrics-grouped-by-personas\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#metrics-grouped-by-personas\" aria-label=\"metrics grouped by personas permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Metrics Grouped by Personas</h2>\n<p>Based on the different personas involved in Project Meteor and identified <a href=\"https://github.com/AICoE/meteor/blob/main/docs/personas.md\">here</a>, we can categorize the metrics as follows:</p>\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>Metrics</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Metric Definition</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Metric Calculation</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Targeted Persona</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>Data Source</strong>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong># New users (daily/weekly/monthly)</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td>Number of new users over time\n   </td>\n   <td>\n   </td>\n   <td>Product Owner\n   </td>\n   <td>Google Analytics\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>Product Adoption rate\n</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td>How many people adopt the product and become regular users\n   </td>\n   <td>(New Users รท Total Users) * 100\n   </td>\n   <td>Product Owner\n   </td>\n   <td>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>User Retention Rate</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td>Rate of users retained over time\n   </td>\n   <td>(# Users end of given period)-(# New users acquired in the period) / (#Users in the beginning of the period) * 100\n   </td>\n   <td>Product Owner\n   </td>\n   <td>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>Daily/Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU)</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td>Number of active users daily/monthly\n   </td>\n   <td>\n   </td>\n   <td>Product Owner\n   </td>\n   <td>Google Analytics\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>Product Stickiness Ratio</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td>Measures the number of people that are highly engaged with the product\n   </td>\n   <td>(DAU) / (MAU) * 100\n   </td>\n   <td>Product Owner\n   </td>\n   <td>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>Product Engagement Score (PES)</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td>How users are interacting with your product\n   </td>\n   <td>(Adoption + Retention + DAU/MAU) / 3 *100\n   </td>\n   <td>Product Owner\n   </td>\n   <td>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>Number of sessions/user</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td>How often users come back and use the site\n   </td>\n   <td>(Total #
