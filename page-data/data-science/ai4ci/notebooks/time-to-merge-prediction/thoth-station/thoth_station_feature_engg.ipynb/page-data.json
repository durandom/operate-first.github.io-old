This way, even if a less prominent word is more correlated with time_to_merge, we will be able to capture that relationship.</p></div></div><div class=\"sc-bxivhb HLmih cell\" style=\"box-shadow:none\"><div class=\"sc-gzVnrw iiEGBE input-container\"><div class=\"sc-bwzfXH jsVRSS prompt\">[35]</div><pre class=\"sc-bZQynM dQAqiJ input\" style=\"color:#393A34;font-family:&quot;Consolas&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Vera Sans Mono&quot;, &quot;Courier New&quot;, Courier, monospace;direction:ltr;text-align:left;white-space:pre;word-spacing:normal;word-break:normal;font-size:0.95em;line-height:1.2em;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;-ms-hyphens:none;hyphens:none;padding:10px 0px 10px 10px;margin:0px;overflow:auto;border:none;background-color:var(--cm-background, #fafafa)\"><code style=\"color:#393A34;font-family:&quot;Consolas&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Vera Sans Mono&quot;, &quot;Courier New&quot;, Courier, monospace;direction:ltr;text-align:left;white-space:pre;word-spacing:normal;word-break:normal;font-size:0.95em;line-height:1.2em;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;-ms-hyphens:none;hyphens:none\"><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#008000;font-style:italic\"># add word count columns</span>\n<span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#0000ff\">for</span> word <span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#0000ff\">in</span> tqdm<span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">(</span>unique_words<span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">)</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">:</span>\n    pr_df<span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">[</span><span class=\"token string-interpolation\"><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#A31515\">f&quot;title_wordcount_</span><span class=\"token interpolation\"><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">{</span>word<span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">}</span></span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#A31515\">&quot;</span></span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">]</span> <span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">=</span> preproc_titles<span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">.</span><span class=\"token builtin\">apply</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">(</span>\n        <span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#0000ff\">lambda</span> x<span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">:</span> x<span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">.</span>split<span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">(</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">)</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">.</span>count<span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">(</span>word<span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#393A34\">)</span></code></pre></div><div class=\"sc-htoDjs wOXyQ nteract-outputs\" style=\"max-height:100%\"><div class=\"cell_display\" style=\"max-height:100%;overflow-y:auto\"><code class=\"nteract-display-area-stderr\"><span>  2%|▏         | 96/4200 [00:00&lt;00:35, 116.28it/s]/tmp/ipykernel_532/4191214648.py:3: PerformanceWarning: DataFrame is highly fragmented.

much variability in the commits number. Majority of the PRs (77%) have 1 commit, 11% have 2 commits and rest(12%) have more than 2 commits. We can break commits number down into 3 categorical variables, <code>contains_1_commit</code>, <code>contains_2_commits</code>, <code>contains_3_or_more_commits</code>. However, there might be some value in knowing whether a PR had 5 commits vs. 10 commits.

We also outlined what is contained in each record and provided a quick demonstration of how to convert the mixed data types into numerical values for statistical analysis and eventually machine learning. </p>\n<p>We have also engineered some possible features which can be used to predict time to merge of a PR. As next steps, we will train a classifier to predict time to merge of a PR using the features.</p></div></div></div></div>","fields":{"srcLink":"https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/ocp-ci-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/time-to-merge-prediction/thoth-station/thoth_station_feature_engg.ipynb"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8dc29bb0-1201-5fbc-b1c7-88c106fd6365 >>> JupyterNotebook"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1764348645","2823140819","3000541721","3606484676"]}
