Along the way, it has had multiple hands in front of and behind the camera to curate the meetup space. The managing, organizing, and running of the meetups is a fairly well-understood process that can be run by one or two people, but should it be run by one or two people? By scaling it beyond just one pair of hands, a group of people who care about the meetup can help steward it into the future, without the meetup being dependent on one person’s evolving job role.</li>\n<li>Are you someone who cares about the Operate First Data Science Meetup? Can you lend some voice to the value this meetup has for you? Would you want to help make the meetup happen through a small time commitment and collaboration with a group of meetup organizers?</li>\n<li>Let’s have an open discussion about how we can scale the meetup process so more of us can get the benefits of helping define and continue the Data Science Meetup. Karsten will give a brief overview of the Operate First project and how data science is central to the project’s mission. He’ll also talk about the value of connection points like meetups, and how and why you can participate in many ways to add to this meetup’s success.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/yH4bpglzJUA\">Video Recording</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>July 12th, 2022 - #16 - <strong>CCO: a next generation cost optimizer for complex cloud workloads</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"pf-c-list\">\n<li>Presented by Ilya Kolchinsky and Adi Yehoshua</li>\n<li>In this session, learn about CCO - a novel optimization engine for minimizing cloud (AWS, Azure, etc.) costs for complex workloads (i.e., with up to hundreds/thousands of applications and/or components).</li>\n<li>The goal of CCO is to calculate the best possible assignment of tasks or application components to cloud instances such that the total monetary cost is minimized or at the very least does not exceed a predefined budget. To that end, the engine periodically collects up-to-date resource prices and statistics, then utilizes advanced algorithmic approaches and machine learning to solve the optimization problem.</li>\n<li>This project is done jointly with the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, as a part of a broader partnership.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/operate-first-data-science-community/blob/main/docs/content/opfmeetup16.pdf\">Slides</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PxLbo1USjqU\">Video Recording</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>June 28th, 2022 - #15 - <strong>The Future of the Operate First Data Science Community</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"pf-c-list\">\n<li>Presented by Michael Clifford <a href=\"https://github.com/MichaelClifford\">@MichaelClifford</a></li>\n<li>The presenter will be discussing some upcoming changes to the Operate First Data Science community at large.

This ends up being a time-consuming process, as many of the YAMLs share a similar structure with differing values based on the specifics of your deployment.</li>\n<li><strong>copilot-ops</strong> is a CLI tool which supercharges your DevOps capabilities by allowing the user to specify what needs to be created/changed, along with some files to provide context on what values the resulting YAML should use.</li>\n<li>By the end of this talk, attendees will know how to use copilot-ops to supercharge their DevOps capabilities and quickly generate or edit desired YAML files at a moment’s notice. Attendees will also walk away with a basic understanding of how Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) can be used for code-generation tasks.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/operate-first-data-science-community/blob/main/docs/content/opfmeetup13.pdf\">Slides</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/eB6JNAaWMUE\">Video Recording</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>May 17th, 2022 - #12 - <strong>Bringing AI and Machine Learning into Operation</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"pf-c-list\">\n<li>By Audrey Reznik</li>\n<li>As a Data Scientist it is often difficult to know where to start your project. Do I test and build my model in an IDE? If I build and test my model in an IDE, how do I connect to my resources such as streaming data or databases? How can I optimize my model inference performance? Once I have optimized my model how do I easily deploy and manage it? Plus what options are available for me to deploy onPrem or in a Hybrid cloud environment?</li>\n<li>In this session we will discuss an easy way to build, test, train and deploy high performant models using a variety of platforms and tools created for OpenShift.</li>\n<li>The attendees will learn about what is Open Datahub, Red Hat OpenShift Data Science and Managed Services.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/operate-first-data-science-community/blob/main/docs/content/opfmeetup12.pdf\">Slides</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mHa2O116RS8\">Video Recording</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>May 3rd, 2022 - #11 - <strong>Data Obfuscation Techniques</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"pf-c-list\">\n<li>By Surya Prakash Pathak <a href=\"https://github.com/suppathak\">@suppathak</a></li>\n<li>A common scenario encountered by data scientists is sharing confidential and sensitive data with others. A lot of data we collect today can easily be linked to an individual, household, or entity. What should we do when we need to share these data with others? One of the methods to anonymize personal and confidential data is by using data obfuscation techniques. Data obfuscation is the process of replacing sensitive information with data that looks like real production information, making it useless to malicious actors.</li>\n<li>In this talk, we will get introduced to different hashing techniques used for data obfuscation. In addition to this, we will also go over the obfuscation technique we used for obfuscating meetup attendees’ data.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/operate-first-data-science-community/blob/main/docs/content/opfmeetup11.pdf\">Slides</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/aj-THe9fFIQ\">Video Recording</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>April 19th, 2022 - #10 - <strong>Distributed ML workloads on OpenShift</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"pf-c-list\">\n<li>By Selbi Nuryyeva</li>\n<li>As the datasets and models get bigger, the demand for more powerful and efficient GPUs is rapidly increasing. Oftentimes a single GPU is not adequate for an ML use case. An alternative to upgrading the GPU hardware is to distribute the ML workload either across several GPUs on one node, or across multiple nodes each containing one or several GPUs. The ability for the latter is especially preferred when a single machine can fit only so many GPUs.</li>\n<li>In this talk, we will explore how one can distribute a machine learning workflow across several nodes with GPU hardware in a cloud environment. We will use PyTorch to carry out the ML training and Kubeflow, Node Feature Discovery and GPU operators to distribute the ML workload.</li>\n<li>The attendees will understand how to overcome the GPU hardware limits of a single node training by taking advantage of GPUs on other machines, and therefore, maximizing the utilization of GPUs in an open cloud environment.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/operate-first-data-science-community/blob/main/docs/content/opfmeetup10.pdf\">Slides</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rFaoM61dglM\">Video Recording</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>April 5th, 2022 - #09 - <strong>AI4CI - Artificial Intelligence for Continuous Integration</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"pf-c-list\">\n<li>By Aakanksha Duggal <a href=\"https://github.com/aakankshaduggal\">@aakankshaduggal</a>, Hema Veeradhi <a href=\"https://github.com/hemajv\">@hemajv</a>, Karan Chauhan, Oindrilla Chatterjee <a href=\"https://github.com/oindrillac\">@oindrillac</a> and Shrey Anand</li>\n<li>In this session, the speakers introduce AI4CI (Artificial Intelligence for Continuous Integration), a collection of open-source AIOps tools involving open operations data made available by Kubernetes testing and visualization platforms.</li>\n<li>The speakers will demonstrate how they developed a set of Jupyter Notebooks which are automated using Kubeflow Pipelines into repeatable processes that collect data from various open CI/CD data platforms, calculate and visualize key performance indicator metrics, build AI/ML services to support operations and create a reproducible workflow around these processes.</li>\n<li>In this session, attendees learn about a set of AIOps services deployed on Operate First that they can start using and get familiarized with how to use the set of tools available on the Operate First cloud to deploy their own workloads.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/operate-first-data-science-community/blob/main/docs/content/opfmeetup9.pdf\">Slides</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/M4thSVYdIT0\">Video Recording</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>March 22nd, 2022 - #08 - <strong>Sandiego</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"pf-c-list\">\n<li>By Cali Dolfi <a href=\"https://github.com/cdolfi\">@cdolfi</a></li>\n<li>In this talk, get an overview of Project Sandiego out of Red Hat’s Open Source Program office.</li>\n<li>Get an understanding of the goals of the project, the tooling currently available, and what is currently in development.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/operate-first-data-science-community/blob/main/docs/content/opfmeetup8.pdf\">Slides</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wuNfy4u64-g\">Video Recording</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>March 8th, 2022 - #07 - <strong>Operate First Cluster Infrastructure</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"pf-c-list\">\n<li>By Humair Khan</li>\n<li>In this talk, get an overview of the Operate-First Cloud Instance.
