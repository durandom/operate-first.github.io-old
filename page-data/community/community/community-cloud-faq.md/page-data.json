href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice\">community of practice (CoP)</a> that has been co-developing an Open Cloud implementation as a living reference model of principles and a laboratory of practices.</p>\n<p>To this point, we have opted to maintain a set of community clusters as the “Operate First community cloud”.\nGoing forward, the project will look to draw practitioners to Operate First through collaboration with other community clusters and community clouds of particular projects or organizations.</p>\n<p>Operate First has been and remains a CoP comprised of developers, operators, and others — site reliability engineers (SRE), data scientists, University researchers, Open Source practitioners, and so forth — who believe in promoting this Open approach to operations. </p>\n<h2 id=\"project-migration\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#project-migration\" aria-label=\"project migration permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg

MOC Alliance and the NERC?</h3>\n<p>Originally the Mass Open Cloud, <a href=\"https://massopen.cloud\">MOC Alliance </a> is a joint project of academia and research institutions, public sector interests, independent and foundation-based Open projects, and private corporations.\nThe goal was to build a regional research cloud, and develop toward how to do a national version.\nThe next evolution of the MOC Alliance is in the new <a href=\"https://i-scale.org\">i-Scale, the Center for Systems Innovations at Scale</a>.</p>\n<p>The latest released offering out of this project is the <a href=\"https://nerc.mghpcc.org/\">New England Research Cloud (NERC)</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"https://mghpcc.org\">Massachusetts Green High-Performance Computing Center</a>.</p>\n<p>The NERC is a researcher and Open project-focused managed community cloud environment for running project applications.\nIt is designed to be more of a steady-state, rather than undergoing constant updates to the latest versions of services.\nThe NERC team seek to balance the value of a cloud environment with the desired features of a staged DevOps environment.</p>\n<p>While it is theoretically possible for an Open Source project to be hosted on the NERC, current limitations for this new offering make it practical if you are part of a participating institution.\nFor example, any Red Hatter with a project can join using the Red Hat Google-based account.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-i-decide-between-red-hat-openshift-service-on-amazon-rosa-and-the-new-england-research-cloud-nerc-offerings\"

running OpenShift, but have some key differences.</p>\n<p>ROSA is a managed OpenShift where the Red Hat Service Delivery team maintain and update the cluster as needed, so you only have to maintain your application layer.\nFor Operate First-hosted projects, the cost to the Open Source project for ROSA is zero.\nHowever, you need to pay for the AWS compute underlying ROSA with operating budget or cloud credits.\nNeither of these are available from the Operate First project, but rather should be sourced from your product business unit or directly from the public cloud provider.</p>\n<p>NERC is a managed OpenShift community cloud where a combined team from Boston University, Harvard University, and others maintain and update the cluster for research purposes.\nOpen Source projects are welcome in this environment, as digital public goods.\nThis is a new OpenShift offering from the MOC Alliance and there may be some costs associated with using it.\nThe intake interview process will get into those details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"are-there-any-access-restrictions-for-rosa-or-nerc\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#are-there-any-access-restrictions-for-rosa-or-nerc\" aria-label=\"are
