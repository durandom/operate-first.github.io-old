State reservation, sometimes with a ‘-1’ signifier</li>\n<li>Reservations about the proposal are worked through, seeking consensus to resolve the reservations.</li>\n<li>A reservation is not a vote against the proposal, but may turn into a vote against if unresolved.\nIt is often expressed with an initial -1 vote to indicate reservations and concerns.\nThis indicates there is still discussion to be had.</li>\n<li>Stand aside?\nNo comment, or state concerns without a -1 reservation; sometimes the ‘-0’ signifier is used.</li>\n<li>This option allows a member to have issues with the proposal without choosing to block the proposal, by instead standing aside with a +/-0 vote.</li>\n<li>The stated concerns may influence other people to have or release reservations.</li>\n<li>Block?\nVote ‘-1’ with reasons for the block.</li>\n<li>This is a complete block on a proposal, refusing to let it pass.\nA block is a -1 vote and must be accompanied with substantive arguments that are rooted in the merit criteria of the Project – protecting the community, the upstream, technical reasons, and so forth.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"use-of-architectural-decision-records-adr\"
