CI or test suites?</h3>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> The <strong>requirement #2</strong> above does <em>not require</em> that any public contributor can trigger the test suite, if that activity is limited to certain known contributors.</p>\n<p>It is common for Open Source projects to limit which contributors can trigger CI or run test suites on their provided infrastructure.\nThis is usually done to prevent abuse such as exfiltrating secrets or denial of service.\nIt’s <em>recommended</em> that your project has a mechanism whereby a known contributor, or maintainer, can review a contribution from an arbitrary contributor and then allow the CI or test suite to run on it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"q-must-a-contribution-workflow-be-documented\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a

that an Open Source project has a documented contribution workflow (eg: a simple CONTRIBUTING file, a wiki, or further documentation).</p>\n<h3

it be possible for anyone to Operate the service?</h3>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> The minimal requirements above <em>do not require</em> that a service can be operated by anyone.\nThe requirements serve to enable others to change the service code so that it can be operated by others, should that be desired.\nIt is by these means that these requirements accommodate the forking of the project, with all the usual tradeoffs and costs.</p>\n<p>However, if a typical team member operates their own instance of the service in order to make changes to it, then <strong>requirement #2</strong> means that public contributors should also be able to do so as well.</p>\n<p>It is a powerful, laudable goal for others to be able to operate an Open Source service, either by operating an instance on their own, or participating in operations of a common instance.\n<a href=\"https://www.operate-first.cloud/\">Operate First</a> is a project that enables this, and even provides infrastructure.</p>\n<h3

all requirements for a service be Open Source too?</h3>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> It is <em>not required</em> that all dependencies of a service are Open Source, or have Open Source alternatives.\nFor

conduct, governance, etc.) is <em>recommended</em>, and brings significant further Open Source benefits.</p>\n<p>Among other things, having a community means sharing your documentation, issues, and a roadmap. It also means conducting most planning conversations about the service in the open, and not limiting participation to your team.
