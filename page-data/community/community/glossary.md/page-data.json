They are a community of operators testing open source code in production, publishing complete, reproducible stacks for existing and emerging workloads, and generally advancing open source infrastructure. The Operate First community of practice lives at OpenInfra Labs, as the origin and place to cultivate the Operate First concept.</p>\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://nerc.mghpcc.org/\">New England Research Cloud (NERC)</a></em></strong> is a new cloud environment for researchers, students, and others.\nThe creation and running of this production cloud is an effort within the Operate First project, consisting of team members from multiple organizations.</p>\n<p>The NERC is the first cloud to directly benefit from the knowledge, tooling, and best-practices created in the Operate First community.\nIt’s disconnected from the Operate First community cloud services, but its implementation mimics what the Operate First community cloud provided.\nIt’s operated by a large number of people, some of whom are also active in operating the Operate First community cloud.</p>\n<p>Data created in MOC is meant to be shared with the research community, but it’s not generally available to the public.</p>\n<h1 id=\"open-source-services\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#open-source-services\" aria-label=\"open source services permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Open Source services</h1>\n<p>Link coming soon:  <a href=\"https://operate-first.cloud/community/open-source-service\">https://operate-first.cloud/community/open-source-service</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"faq\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#faq\" aria-label=\"faq permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>FAQ</h1>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> Are projects like Quay or 3Scale already operating first? They are running an instance as a service and are available as a product and an open-source project.</p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> To some extent yes. They already capture operational knowledge in a production environment. On the other hand, the production environment is not open for customers or a community to be freely examined or open for direct contributions. The contribution funnel is still via the open-source code base.</p>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is OpenShiftDedicated an implementation of operate first for OpenShift?</p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> To some extent yes. By opening up most of the configuration and tooling being used to run OSD there is a direct feedback loop to OCP. But it’s still missing out on opportunities for direct contributions since there is no second or Nth deployment of OSD and it’s supporting services.</p>","fields":{"srcLink":"https://github.com/operate-first/community/blob/master/glossary.md"},"frontmatter":{"title":"","description":null,"extraClasses":null,"banner":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"756ec200-a468-5545-92be-ec29f20d4f5b"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1764348645","2823140819","3000541721","3606484676"]}
