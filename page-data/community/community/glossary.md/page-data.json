To ensure that software projects address operational considerations, there must be a new method by which developers experience the operation of their projects in a real cloud setting. This is the idea behind Operate First. Operate your code in a cloud first, while still in development, then release.</p>\n<p>Operate First is a <strong>concept</strong> where developers bring their projects to a production cloud during development where they can interact with a cloud provider’s operators and gain valuable feedback on the operational considerations of their project. They gain first-hand knowledge of the operations and take that knowledge back to factor into their ongoing development processes.</p>\n<p>Operate First is inspired by<a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/what-open-source-upstream\"> Upstream First</a>, which emphasizes working in the open, and extends it to a part of the codebase that teams typically keep closed, even when deploying open source projects: their operations code.</p>\n<p>Operate First wants to leverage the community contributor funnel of Open Source to establish a flow of knowledge from users to maintainers and operators of software and services to enable the above and grow new talent.</p>\n<p>The motivation for the Operate First initiative is the shift of focus from software availability to operating services: Open Source removed the access to software as a limiting factor for businesses and individuals. However, with software proliferating into every aspect of the business - and our world in general - resulting in ever growing complexity of software stacks, the challenge now is operationalizing software.</p>\n<p>Making software available is not sufficient unless we are also making available the capability to operate the software in production. This is why cloud has become the dominant operational paradigm of IT, and is posing a growing challenge to Open Source. Proprietary services based on Open Source are undermining the Open Source model itself and the lack of capability to operate is the new limiting factor for ourselves and our users.</p>\n<p>In order to address this issue, the software development and productization process must include building the required operational knowledge and encapsulating it in the software itself. Development teams must build a practical understanding of what it means to put their software into operations, in order to serve their users’ needs.</p>\n<p>The concept goes beyond software, with many different places and ways the Operate First concept helps beyond just improving the code:</p>\n<ul class=\"pf-c-list\">\n<li>Upstream and Downstream - e.g. Kubevirt and CNV</li>\n<li>Platforms - e.g. OpenShift or OpenStack</li>\n<li>Features of those platforms - e.g. Istio or KubeVirt</li>\n<li>Supporting services - e.g. ArgoCD for workloads</li>\n<li>Cloud-native projects - e.g. Kubeflow or OpenDataHub</li>\n<li>Workloads - e.g. community hosted websites</li>\n<li>Incubating community projects - e.g. SigStore or IBM Mesh-4-Data</li>\n<li>Living Reference Architectures - e.g. MANUela edge demo</li>\n<li>Software as a Services - e.g. RedHat Insights or Managed Kafka</li>\n<li>Configuration data - e.g. deployment manifests</li>\n<li>SRE content - e.g. SLI/SLOs, Dashboards, scripts, and tools</li>\n<li>Automation - e.g. Bots, Pipeline definitions</li>\n<li>Operational data sets - e.g. Logs, Metrics, Incidents</li>\n<li>Architectural Decision Records - Documents describing a thought process</li>\n<li>Community Building - enabling contribution and growing talent</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"an-operate-first-cloud-environment\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#an-operate-first-cloud-environment\" aria-label=\"an operate first cloud environment permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>An Operate First cloud environment</h1>\n<p>An Operate First cloud environment is as<a href=\"https://github.com/operate-first/blueprint/issues/78\"> open as possible</a>—an environment where anonymous visitors can read as much as possible and signup for accessing the environment is as easy as for any other modern service.  Of course all within legal boundaries. The setup should mimic the setup of open source code repositories.</p>\n<p>Since most clouds, like university or company-run services, have stricter legal requirements, it’s necessary to disconnect the Operate First Cloud from those environments to prevent leakage of data. [Assertion needs clarification to explain that when in a non-commercial dynamic working on open source, the data retention requirements are different. For example, GDPR has exceptions that open source projects use to exempt themselves from tracking PII that is part of openly published data, such as an email address being available in an open mailing list archive is a business requirement for the project; this is different from a commercial cloud environment. By having an Operate First community cloud environment separate from a commercial cloud, you don’t get e.g. a user address from the commercial side end up in the community dataset and thus exposed publicly.]</p>\n<p>The environment is operated by a community with a best-effort support SLA.
