That is, a persona that has the primary interest in the commercial success of that service. The Service Owner takes responsibility for the success of the service and provides the strategic leadership and business context that is needed by engineers, especially during the difficult times. Without this persona, the service would not exist, and thus all other personas rely on this one. They are often referred to as the ‘Champions’ of this service.</p>\n<h4 id=\"product-ownermanager\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#product-ownermanager\" aria-label=\"product ownermanager permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Product Owner/Manager</h4>\n<p>With the strategic guidance of the Service Owner, this persona (also sometimes referred to as the Product Manager) decides on the priority of work (in this context, that may be categorized as ‘feature’ work or ‘reliability work’). They take their inputs from many sources. Reliability, of course, is a significant input, but it is not the only input. There are many other factors which affect their decision-making. Often, they need to balance the inputs from customers and the business, with the engineering resources that are available and these demands can often be conflicting. It is the task of this role to successfully navigate all the demands, providing a path forward.</p>\n<p>Additionally, many services are dependent on other services, which have their own Product Owners. Therefore, this persona also plays a critical role in managing those dependencies, liaising with other Product Owners and Engineering resources to effectively prioritize work. Using agile concepts, this role is analogous to a ‘Product Owner’.</p>\n<h4 id=\"engineering-managers\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#engineering-managers\" aria-label=\"engineering managers permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Engineering Managers</h4>\n<p>Work needs to be done. The majority of this work is undertaken by Developers, who comprise teams led by an Engineering Manager. The primary role of this persona is to enable those teams to do the (best) work they need to do, as it is prioritized by the Product Owner. This role must also maintain working relationships with peer Engineering managers, especially where co-dependencies, shared goals and natural affinities exist.</p>\n<h4 id=\"developerssoftware-engineers\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#developerssoftware-engineers\" aria-label=\"developerssoftware engineers permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Developers/Software Engineers</h4>\n<p>This persona implements the service in accordance with the ‘plan’ (as mostly determined by the Product Owner). They turn this plan into reality, creating and maintaining the code which underpins the service. Not only are they most often responsible for implementing the functionality of the service (in this context “feature work”), but they are also key contributors to helping the software operate reliably (“reliability work”). However, it is also important to acknowledge that it is not only Developers who are concerned with how the service ‘operates’. Everyone has a significant part to play. However, in this context, Developers were highlighted to emphasize the concept of identifying operational concerns right up-front at the beginning of any project, and the developers, themselves, taking a special care for how it runs.</p>\n<p>Also, it is important to acknowledge that there are developers who are also functioning as SREs, and in fact this is definitely in the spirit of Site Reliability Engineering in general. An example may be a smaller Engineering team who fill many roles, or maybe a newer service that is early in its stages of maturity. However, for the purpose of these personas, consider the person acting in the role of a “Developer” when performing that function, and similarly acting in the role of an SRE when performing that function.</p>\n<h4 id=\"engineeringarchitecture-lead\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#engineeringarchitecture-lead\" aria-label=\"engineeringarchitecture lead permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Engineering/Architecture Lead</h4>\n<p>The Developers and SREs do not work in isolation. To obtain the economies of scale that are necessary, and to make sure that work is not duplicated, they need to conform to the ‘systems (including processes)’ and ‘architecture’ that best suits the business goal. This is the primary role of this persona. They provide the “guard-rails” for the developers, and help keep the services aligned with accepted strategic technical direction. They also have a key role in developing best practices, and coaching teams to avoid anti-patterns.</p>\n<h4 id=\"quality-engineer\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quality-engineer\" aria-label=\"quality engineer permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Quality Engineer</h4>\n<p>Quality Engineering (QE) installs and manages instances of the product primarily for the purpose of bug and regression testing, informing Developers of reliability issues and grounding confidence for the other personas that the product functions as intended in the subset of situations covered by QE.

Their primary focus is ensuring that the services are “running”. When there is a problem, it is up to them to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. However, this is only the end goal. The role of an SRE is to contribute to the reliability of the service so that the need to fix something is the exception rather than the rule. This is best epitomized in this quote by one of Red Hat’s SRE Managers: “Do not accept repeated failure”. That is, if something fails (e.g. SRE is alerted), then follow through with all “actions” so that the problem does not repeat. These actions can be things like: from identifying the issue with the responsible engineering team through to actually fixing the problem in code, personally. </p>\n<p>In many organizations, SRE functions support more than one service. Many projects undertaken by SRE teams provide the tooling, workflows and platforms needed to operate at scale. A key metric is for the SRE team to grow sub-linearly with “hockey stick” customer growth while minimizing toil and technical debt.</p>\n<p>SREs are also valuable consultants, particularly in these key areas: observability; automation; resilience; toil prevention; capacity planning; and, operability. They are most familiar with their operational boundaries, they own the core of the incident and problem management processes and are accountable for it and their continuous improvement, and can best articulate the problems being encountered since they are hands-on.</p>\n<h4 id=\"support-engineer\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#support-engineer\" aria-label=\"support engineer permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Support Engineer</h4>\n<p>This persona provides assistance to Service Consumers, usually in the form of support cases raised by customers.
