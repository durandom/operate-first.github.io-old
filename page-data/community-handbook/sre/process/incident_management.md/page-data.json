The process below would be used when the incident is considered to be a major incident. When the incident is a minor one then a lightweight ad-hoc process can be used. The goal being to make sure not to make the process too heavy for small incidents.</p>\n<p>A major outage can be defined when our platform is running out of error budget or when we start failing our SLOs.</p>\n<p>Examples of major incidents:</p>\n<ul class=\"pf-c-list\">\n<li>Full outage or heavy degradation of one or multiple services impacting one or several customers</li>\n<li>Duration of the incident is greater than 4 hours</li>\n<li>Multiple layers and SRE teams are impacted (platform, application, …)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that when a team has a path for fast recovery then they shouldn’t break it to fit that process if it’s not required.</p>\n<h2 id=\"quick-reference-guide\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quick-reference-guide\" aria-label=\"quick reference guide permalink\"
